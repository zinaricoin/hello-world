About Us

Zinari (Zina) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) token built to enable cross-border commercial transactions. The system enables traders and payees to send money using a decentralized network to their clients or investors in other territories.
It combines the attributes of the gold standard, the universality and decentralization of Bitcoin and the trust attributes of fiat. Zinari is not here to destroy the current monetary system, but to improve on it and make transactions far better.
For instance, a trader in Nigeria will be able to use the Zinari platform to swap his Naira to CNY using the Zina standard and then send it to his vendor or family in China seamlessly. This system will work perfectly for both large and tiny transactions. Also, people will be able to store their money in Zinari to save them from the fluctuations and problems of their weak local currency.
Zina isnâ€™t just a crypto token to be used by people with technical knowledge; Zinari will make it very easy for even uneducated traders to run transactions, both in cash or digitally.
